# Serverless Framework AWS NodeJS API with CRUD operations

This repository demonstrates how to implements a simple CRUD operation to a fictional database of customers using the Serverless Framework with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (112s)

functions:
  hello: aws-node-project-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

### Tests

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using a rest client and test all common methods (POST,PUT, GET, DELETE)
